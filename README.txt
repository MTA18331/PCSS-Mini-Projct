To use the chat program you follow these three simple steps:

1. Open "MultipleClientServer.exe", which opens the server allowing the clients to connect.
2. Open either of the Testclients-files, which will open a client and connect it to the server.
3. Open the other TestClient file and chat between these clients!

Enjoy!
